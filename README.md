# Artificial Intelligence for Financial Markets. NUMERAI

I though I'd share some of the fun (aka scripts) I've been having competing at NUMERAI using R and other open source tools.

The intent is to share a series of scripts of increasing complexity that would allow someone to reach top positions on the leaderboard and, hopefully, to engourage people to share their solutions. Well... maybe not those that would take you to Top 10 but humain generosity knows no limits :-)
